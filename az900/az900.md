      To avoid regulations with certain geo location & data security policy violation.
   - Availability Zones & Region Pairs
      - Regions within a geography.
      - Data centers generally 300miles apart to avoid natural calamity impacts
      - Automatic replication and failover for some services
      - High Availability with service update and Outage recovery prioritization.  
   - Azure Geography
   ![Location](../az900/Geography.PNG)
         Multiple available zones within same region and multiple regions within same geography is to create load balancing and handle large number of requests and fail overs.
