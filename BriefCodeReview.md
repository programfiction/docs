## Team Responsibility:
-	A solution/ project should compile well without error or warning. 
-	A program or a snippet is not complete, without developer-tested and unit tests cases.	
-	A complete documentation also crucial for a solution. 
-	A snippet is tidy (indentation, line length, no commented-out code, no spelling mistakes, etc).
-	We have to consider proper use of exceptions handling using Middleware.
-	We have to impose appropriate use of logging	
-	Make sure unused imports/usings are removed
-	The code should follow Coding Standards c#9/latest	
-	Are there any leftover stubs or test routines in the code?	
-	Are there any hardcoded, development only things still in the code?	
-	Solution should be platform independent
-	Security scan with any standard tool is must. E.g. veracode
-	Does the code release resources? (web connections, DataBase connection,static files)	
-	Corner cases well documented or any workaround for a known limitation of the frameworks
-	Can any code be replaced by calls to external reusable components or library functions?	
-	Design pattern need to take care of possible deadlocks. Use of CQRS

## Code reviewer pool responsibility:
- A code reviewer must make sure comments are comprehensible & neither numerous nor verbose.
- A code reviewer should find types are generalized where possible & parameterized types are used appropriately.
- A code reviewer also takes care of exceptions handling are proper or not. Also common error codes should return where needed with standard error format across project.
- Design should follow SOLID principle & Development standards.
    - A class should have single responsibility.
    - Methods should be short and defined appropriately in class using interface.
    -Repetitive code should be factored out. 
    - Naming convention should be standardized
    - Performance was considered during development
    - Code should not have unjustifiable method and code
- A code reviewer pool should standardize unit testing and should have a baseline 70~80 % of code coverage.
- Security concerns have been addressed.
- Logging implementation is also vital during code review to identify performance & issues.
